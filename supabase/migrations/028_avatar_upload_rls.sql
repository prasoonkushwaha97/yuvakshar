-- Migration: 028_avatar_upload_rls.sql
-- Purpose: Setup Storage RLS policies for avatars bucket and ensure profiles table allows updates.

-- 1. Ensure avatars bucket exists and is public
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = true;

-- 2. Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Storage Policies for Avatars bucket
-- Allow public to read all avatars
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public avatars are viewable by everyone" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Public avatars are viewable by everyone"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own avatar
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own avatar
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- 4. Ensure RLS on profiles allows the user to update their own profile
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" 
ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Just to be safe, make sure they can also select their own or everyone's profile
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" 
ON public.profiles FOR SELECT 
USING (true);
